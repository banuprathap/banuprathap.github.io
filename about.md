Hello! Welcome to my personal blog.

I'm a Robotics Engineer with a background in Mechatronics. I love building robots and making their software efficient. I love projects across control, motion planning, perception and mapping. You can find me deep diving into opensource code bases in my free time. I also enjoy running and hiking.

I'm currently working as a Robotics Software Engineer at [Ava Robotics](https://www.avarobotics.com), leading the software efforts on the mobile robot base.
